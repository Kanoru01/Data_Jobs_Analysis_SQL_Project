# The Analysis

Each query aims at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's the approach to each question:

### 1. Highest-Paying Data Analyst Roles

To retrieve the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions that are remote friendly and have specified salaries. I then sorted out the results in descending order and limited it to 10 rows to get the top 10 highest paying jobs.

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    name AS company_name,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
The table below lists the top 10 highest-paying data analyst roles:

| job_id   | job_title                                      | company                                     | salary_year_avg |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|

- With __6 out of 10__ of the highest-paying data analyst roles being that of a senior level, we can conclude the the highest salaries for data analyst roles are mostly associated with senior positions.

### 2. Key Skills for Top-Paying Data Analyst Positions

To Identify the skills needed for the top-paying data analyst positions, associating each job with its required skills using inner joins between job postings and skill-related tables, ensuring that only jobs with specified skills are included.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    name AS company_name,
    salary_year_avg
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills 
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
-- Inner join to get the skills associated with the top-paying jobs.
-- A left join has no effect as it will also give us the jobs without skills.
ORDER BY top_paying_jobs.salary_year_avg DESC;
```
